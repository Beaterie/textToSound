[" said she, "" and she left him no peace until he consented. "" "" And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel: "" She gave each a little piece of bread, and said: "" "" The wife said: "" Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said: "" But Hansel comforted her and said: "" The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.  Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father: "" said Hansel, ""  The children answered:   ""  and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: "" Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: "" Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.  And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried: "" said the old woman, "" said the witch, "" "" and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.  Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried: "" Then Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch""  When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of water. "" said Hansel, "" answered Gretel, ""s never a plank, or bridge in sight,   Take us across on thy back so white."]

Hansel
["I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me,""Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away."" Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel""If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.""  Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. "" She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. "" And once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ""These are far better than pebbles!""I, too, will take something home with me,""But now we must be off,""that we may get out of the witch"" "" Then she cried:   "]

woman
["Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.""Fool!""that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.""Now, then, Gretel,""stir yourself, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.""Dear God, do help us,""Just keep your noise to yourself,""it won"]

wife
[" said the man, "]

goose
[" said the old woman. "]

father
[" said Hansel, "" Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.  When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ""  Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said: "" And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.  They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: "" The man""It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children.""Hansel, why do you stop and look round?""go on."]

husband
["I"" answered the woman, "]

it
["Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.""s house. They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. "" Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlour:   "" She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.  The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly: "" Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: "]

children
[" said the man.  The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ""We shall soon find the way,"]

man
["s house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father"]

sister
[" and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying: "" Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said: "]

Gretel
[" said Hansel, ""No,""that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other."]

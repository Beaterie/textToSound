["That I don’t believe,""Dead he certainly is not,""That is my story,""Gently, gently,""Yes--listen,""but it will be difficult for me to speak your language. If you understand the Raven language I can tell you better.""No matter,""I will tell you as well as I can; however, it will be bad enough.""In the kingdom where we now are there lives a Princess, who is extraordinarily clever; for she has read all the newspapers in the whole world, and has forgotten them again--so clever is she. She was lately, it is said, sitting on her throne--which is not very amusing after all--when she began humming an old tune, and it was just, ‘Oh, why should I not be married?’ ‘That song is not without its meaning,’ said she, and so then she was determined to marry; but she would have a husband who knew how to give an answer when he was spoken to--not one who looked only as if he were a great personage, for that is so tiresome. She then had all the ladies of the court drummed together; and when they heard her intention, all were very pleased, and said, ‘We are very glad to hear it; it is the very thing we were thinking of.’ You may believe every word I say,""for I have a tame sweetheart that hops about in the palace quite free, and it was she who told me all this.  ""Yes, Yes,""you may believe it; it is as true as I am sitting here. People came in crowds; there was a crush and a hurry, but no one was successful either on the first or second day. They could all talk well enough when they were out in the street; but as soon as they came inside the palace gates, and saw the guard richly dressed in silver, and the lackeys in gold on the staircase, and the large illuminated saloons, then they were abashed; and when they stood before the throne on which the Princess was sitting, all they could do was to repeat the last word they had uttered, and to hear it again did not interest her very much. It was just as if the people within were under a charm, and had fallen into a trance till they came out again into the street; for then--oh, then--they could chatter enough. There was a whole row of them standing from the town-gates to the palace. I was there myself to look,""Patience, patience; we are just come to him. It was on the third day when a little personage without horse or equipage, came marching right boldly up to the palace; his eyes shone like yours, he had beautiful long hair, but his clothes were very shabby.""He had a little knapsack at his back,""That may be,""I did not examine him so minutely; but I know from my tame sweetheart, that when he came into the court-yard of the palace, and saw the body-guard in silver, the lackeys on the staircase, he was not the least abashed; he nodded, and said to them, ‘It must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs; for my part, I shall go in.’ The saloons were gleaming with lustres--privy councillors and excellencies were walking about barefooted, and wore gold keys; it was enough to make any one feel uncomfortable. His boots creaked, too, so loudly, but still he was not at all afraid.""I know he had on new boots; I have heard them creaking in grandmama’s room.""Yes, they creaked,""And did Kay get the Princess?""He was so clever; he could reckon fractions in his head. Oh, won’t you take me to the palace?""That is very easily said,""My intended has told me so much good of you, my dear young lady,""They are only dreams,""How plump, how beautiful she is! She must have been fed on nut-kernels,""She shall play with me,""Who should know better than I?""The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there the children to greet.""They are gone abroad,"]

Kay
["It is the white bees that are swarming,""Look, how clever!""Gerda, sweet little Gerda! Where have you been so long? And where have I been?""How empty and cold!""The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there the children to greet."]

woman
["Poor little child!""I have often longed for such a dear little girl,""Oh!"]

Princess
["Will you fly about here at liberty,""or would you like to have a fixed appointment as court ravens, with all the broken bits from the kitchen?"]

grandmother
["Yes,""she flies where the swarm hangs in the thickest clusters. She is the largest of all; and she can never remain quietly on the earth, but goes up again into the black clouds. Many a winter’s night she flies through the streets of the town, and peeps in at the windows; and they then freeze in so wondrous a manner that they look like flowers.""The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet,      And angels descend there the children to greet.""The boy is certainly very clever!""We have travelled fast,""but it is freezingly cold. Come under my bearskin.""Are you still cold?""Now you will have no more kisses,""or else I should kiss you to death!""Kay is dead and gone!""I’ll put on my red shoes,""Kay has never seen them, and then I’ll go down to the river and ask there.""Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay,""How did you get upon the large rapid river, to be driven about so in the wide world!""But come and tell me who you are, and how you came here,""A-hem! a-hem!""Now you shall see how well we agree together""Are there no roses here?""Do you think he is dead and gone?""We have been in the earth where all the dead are, but Kay was not there.""Hearest thou not the drum? Bum! Bum! Those are the only two tones. Always bum! Bum! Hark to the plaintive song of the old woman, to the call of the priests! The Hindoo woman in her long robe stands upon the funeral pile; the flames rise around her and her dead husband, but the Hindoo woman thinks on the living one in the surrounding circle; on him whose eyes burn hotter than the flames--on him, the fire of whose eyes pierces her heart more than the flames which soon will burn her body to ashes. Can the heart’s flame die in the flame of the funeral pile?"]

Gerda
["Kay is dead and gone!""What!""Many thanks!""Don’t you know where little Kay is?""I don’t understand that at all,""Projecting over a narrow mountain-path there hangs an old feudal castle. Thick evergreens grow on the dilapidated walls, and around the altar, where a lovely maiden is standing: she bends over the railing and looks out upon the rose. No fresher rose hangs on the branches than she; no appleblossom carried away by the wind is more buoyant! How her silken robe is rustling!  ""alone""It may be--it may be!""Does he live with a Princess?""No, I have not learnt it,""but my grandmother understands it, and she can speak gibberish too. I wish I had learnt it.""They grew hungry and thirsty; but from the palace they got nothing whatever, not even a glass of water. Some of the cleverest, it is true, had taken bread and butter with them: but none shared it with his neighbor, for each thought, ‘Let him look hungry, and then the Princess won’t have him.’""But Kay--little Kay,""when did he come? Was he among the number?""That was Kay,""No, that was certainly his sledge,""for when he went away he took his sledge with him.""That’s Kay for certain,""And on he went boldly up to the Princess, who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning-wheel. All the ladies of the court, with their attendants and attendants’ attendants, and all the cavaliers, with their gentlemen and gentlemen’s gentlemen, stood round; and the nearer they stood to the door, the prouder they looked. It was hardly possible to look at the gentleman’s gentleman, so very haughtily did he stand in the doorway.""It must have been terrible,""Were I not a Raven, I should have taken the Princess myself, although I am promised. It is said he spoke as well as I speak when I talk Raven language; this I learned from my tame sweetheart. He was bold and nicely behaved; he had not come to woo the Princess, but only to hear her wisdom. She pleased him, and he pleased her.""Yes, yes; for certain that was Kay,""But how are we to manage it? I’ll speak to my tame sweetheart about it: she must advise us; for so much I must tell you, such a little girl as you are will never get permission to enter.""Oh, yes I shall,""when Kay hears that I am here, he will come out directly to fetch me.""She sends you her compliments; and here is a roll for you. She took it out of the kitchen, where there is bread enough. You are hungry, no doubt. It is not possible for you to enter the palace, for you are barefooted: the guards in silver, and the lackeys in gold, would not allow it; but do not cry, you shall come in still. My sweetheart knows a little back stair that leads to the bedchamber, and she knows where she can get the key of it.""I think there is somebody just behind us,""They come to fetch the thoughts of the high personages to the chase; ‘tis well, for now you can observe them in bed all the better. But let me find, when you enjoy honor and distinction, that you possess a grateful heart.""No,""They shall not kill you, even if I am angry with you: then I will do it myself""Do you intend to keep your knife while you sleep?""There is no knowing what may happen. But tell me now, once more, all about little Kay; and why you have started off in the wide world alone.""Coo! Coo! We have seen little Kay! A white hen carries his sledge; he himself sat in the carriage of the Snow Queen, who passed here, down just over the wood, as we lay in our nest. She blew upon us young ones; and all died except we two. Coo! Coo!""What is that you say up there?""She is no doubt gone to Lapland; for there is always snow and ice there. Only ask the Reindeer, who is tethered there.""One can spring about in the large shining valleys! The Snow Queen has her summer-tent there; but her fixed abode is high up towards the North Pole, on the Island called Spitzbergen.""Oh, Kay! Poor little Kay!""If you don’t, I shall make you.""That’s no matter--that’s no matter. Do you know where Lapland lies!""I was born and bred there--there I leapt about on the fields of snow.""You see that the men are gone; but my mother is still here, and will remain. However, towards morning she takes a draught out of the large flask, and then she sleeps a little: then I will do something for you.""Farewell!""Oh! I have not got my boots! I have not brought my gloves!""But the Raven?""His tame sweetheart is a widow, and wears a bit of black worsted round her leg; she laments most piteously, but it’s all mere talk and stuff! Now tell me what you’ve been doing and how you managed to catch him."]

["I have permission to go out into the square where the others are playing""My sledge! Do not forget my sledge!""Ddsa! Ddsa!"]

it
["Here we are! Here we are!"‘Is he not yet come?’"  "Is it Kay that you mean?" asked little Gerda.  "I am speaking about my story--about my dream," answered the Convolvulus.  What did the Snowdrops say?  "Between the trees a long board is hanging--it is a swing. Two little girls are sitting in it, and swing themselves backwards and forwards; their frocks are as white as snow, and long green silk ribands flutter from their bonnets. Their brother, who is older than they are, stands up in the swing; he twines his arms round the cords to hold himself fast, for in one hand he has a little cup, and in the other a clay-pipe. He is blowing soap-bubbles. The swing moves, and the bubbles float in charming changing colors: the last is still hanging to the end of the pipe, and rocks in the breeze. The swing moves. The little black dog, as light as a soap-bubble, jumps up on his hind legs to try to get into the swing. It moves, the dog falls down, barks, and is angry. They tease him; the bubble bursts! A swing, a bursting bubble--such is my song!"  "What you relate may be very pretty, but you tell it in so melancholy a manner, and do not mention Kay."  What do the Hyacinths say?  "There were once upon a time three sisters, quite transparent, and very beautiful. The robe of the one was red, that of the second blue, and that of the third white. They danced hand in hand beside the calm lake in the clear moonshine. They were not elfin maidens, but mortal children. A sweet fragrance was smelt, and the maidens vanished in the wood; the fragrance grew stronger--three coffins, and in them three lovely maidens, glided out of the forest and across the lake: the shining glow-worms flew around like little floating lights. Do the dancing maidens sleep, or are they dead? The odour of the flowers says they are corpses; the evening bell tolls for the dead!"  "You make me quite sad," said little Gerda. "I cannot help thinking of the dead maidens. Oh! is little Kay really dead? The Roses have been in the earth, and they say no."  "Ding, dong!" sounded the Hyacinth bells. "We do not toll for little Kay; we do not know him. That is our way of singing, the only one we have."  And Gerda went to the Ranunculuses, that looked forth from among the shining green leaves.  "You are a little bright sun!" said Gerda. "Tell me if you know where I can find my playfellow."  And the Ranunculus shone brightly, and looked again at Gerda. What song could the Ranunculus sing? It was one that said nothing about Kay either.  "In a small court the bright sun was shining in the first days of spring. The beams glided down the white walls of a neighbor’s house, and close by the fresh yellow flowers were growing, shining like gold in the warm sun-rays. An old grandmother was sitting in the air; her grand-daughter, the poor and lovely servant just come for a short visit. She knows her grandmother. There was gold, pure virgin gold in that blessed kiss. There, that is my little story," said the Ranunculus.  "My poor old grandmother!" sighed Gerda. "Yes, she is longing for me, no doubt: she is sorrowing for me, as she did for little Kay. But I will soon come home, and then I will bring Kay with me. It is of no use asking the flowers; they only know their own old rhymes, and can tell me nothing." And she tucked up her frock, to enable her to run quicker; but the Narcissus gave her a knock on the leg, just as she was going to jump over it. So she stood still, looked at the long yellow flower, and asked, "You perhaps know something?" and she bent down to the Narcissus. And what did it say?  "I can see myself--I can see myself! Oh, how odorous I am! Up in the little garret there stands, half-dressed, a little Dancer. She stands now on one leg, now on both; she despises the whole world; yet she lives only in imagination. She pours water out of the teapot over a piece of stuff which she holds in her hand; it is the bodice; cleanliness is a fine thing. The white dress is hanging on the hook; it was washed in the teapot, and dried on the roof. She puts it on, ties a saffron-colored kerchief round her neck, and then the gown looks whiter. I can see myself--I can see myself!"  "That’s nothing to me," said little Gerda. "That does not concern me."  And then off she ran to the further end of the garden.  The gate was locked, but she shook the rusted bolt till it was loosened, and the gate opened; and little Gerda ran off barefooted into the wide world. She looked round her thrice, but no one followed her. At last she could run no longer; she sat down on a large stone, and when she looked about her, she saw that the summer had passed; it was late in the autumn, but that one could not remark in the beautiful garden, where there was always sunshine, and where there were flowers the whole year round.  "Dear me, how long I have staid!" said Gerda. "Autumn is come. I must not rest any longer." And she got up to go further.  Oh, how tender and wearied her little feet were! All around it looked so cold and raw: the long willow-leaves were quite yellow, and the fog dripped from them like water; one leaf fell after the other: the sloes only stood full of fruit, which set one’"Caw! Caw!"]

Snow Queen
["If you can discover that figure, you shall be your own master, and I will make you a present of the whole world and a pair of new skates.""I am going now to warm lands,""I will just give them a coating of white, for that is as it ought to be; besides, it is good for the oranges and the grapes."]

girl
["Can the Snow Queen come in?""Then I’d put her on the stove, and she’d melt.""What are you doing?""What horrid beasts have you there?""Oh, how long I have stayed!""I intended to look for Kay! Don’t you know where he is?""What, do you really think so?""I think I know; I think that it may be little Kay. But now he has forgotten you for the Princess.""Oh, now I’ve found him!""Kiss it,""Up there is the rabble of the wood,""that’s the rabble; they would all fly away immediately, if they were not well fastened in. And here is my dear old Bac""We are obliged to lock this fellow in too, or he would make his escape. Every evening I tickle his neck with my sharp knife; he is so frightened at it!"]

boy
["Do the white bees choose a queen?""Only let her come in!""I think it is out now,""What are you crying for?""You look so ugly! There’s nothing the matter with me. Ah,""that rose is cankered! And look, this one is quite crooked! After all, these roses are very ugly! They are just like the box they are planted in!""Look through this glass, Gerda,""That’s much more interesting than real flowers! They are as exact as possible; there is not a fault in them, if they did not melt!""Wait for me here on these steps,""Caw--caw!""He will, no doubt, be glad to see you--to hear what a long way you have come for his sake; to know how unhappy all at home were when he did not come back.""Your tale is very affecting. If you will take the lamp, I will go before. We will go straight on, for we shall meet no one.""How cold it is here!"]

maiden
["I will go into the carriage,""They shall not kill you as long as I am not displeased with you. You are, doubtless, a Princess?""You shall sleep with me to-night, with all my animals,""They are all mine,""I always sleep with the knife,""Where did the Snow Queen go to? Do you know anything about it?""Do you choose to be quiet?""Listen,""Good morrow, my own sweet nanny-goat of a mother.""Here are your worsted leggins, for it will be cold; but the muff I shall keep for myself, for it is so very pretty. But I do not wish you to be cold. Here is a pair of lined gloves of my mother’s; they just reach up to your elbow. On with them! Now you look about the hands just like my ugly old mother!""I can’t bear to see you fretting,""Schnipp-schnapp-schnurre-basselurre,"]

mother
["You naughty child!""She shall give me her muff, and her pretty frock; she shall sleep in my bed!""Look, how she is dancing with the little one!""I should very much like to give you still many a tickling with the sharp knife, for then you are so amusing; however, I will untether you, and help you out, so that you may go back to Lapland. But you must make good use of your legs; and take this little girl for me to the palace of the Snow Queen, where her playfellow is. You have heard, I suppose, all she said; for she spoke loud enough, and you were listening.""This is just the time when you ought to look pleased. Here are two loaves and a ham for you, so that you won’t starve.""Kay, sweet little Kay! Have I then found you at last?""You are a fine fellow for tramping about,""I should like to know, faith, if you deserve that one should run from one end of the world to the other for your sake?""Oh! The Raven is dead,"]

Prince
["Poor little thing!""How good men and animals are!""Farewell! Farewell!"]

children
["Yes, I have seen it,""Oh! I feel such a sharp pain in my heart; and now something has got into my eye!""That I don’t believe,""Is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? I will make you a present of my red shoes, if you will give him back to me.""Tut! That’s not worth talking about,""It is a good thing to have a provision for our old days.""'Tis gold! 'Tis gold!""She is as good as a fatted lamb! How nice she will be!""Ddsa! Ddsa!""Farewell! Farewell!""tick! tack!""Unless ye become as little children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven."]

Finland
["The strength of twelve men!""'Tis true little Kay is at the Snow Queen’s, and finds everything there quite to his taste; and he thinks it the very best place in the world; but the reason of that is, he has a splinter of glass in his eye, and in his heart. These must be got out first; otherwise he will never go back to mankind, and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him.""I can give her no more power than what she has already. Don’t you see how great it is? Don’t you see how men and animals are forced to serve her; how well she gets through the world barefooted? She must not hear of her power from us; that power lies in her heart, because she is a sweet and innocent child! If she cannot get to the Snow Queen by herself, and rid little Kay of the glass, we cannot help her. Two miles hence the garden of the Snow Queen begins; thither you may carry the little girl. Set her down by the large bush with red berries, standing in the snow; don’t stay talking, but hasten back as fast as possible.""eternity""I must have a look down into the black caldrons."]

Reindeer
["Ice and snow is there! There it is, glorious and beautiful!""Now, off with you; but take good care of the little girl!""These are my old northern-lights,""look how they gleam!""You are so clever,""you can, I know, twist all the winds of the world together in a knot. If the seaman loosens one knot, then he has a good wind; if a second, then it blows pretty stiffly; if he undoes the third and fourth, then it rages so that the forests are upturned. Will you give the little maiden a potion, that she may possess the strength of twelve men, and vanquish the Snow Queen?""Much good that would be!""But can you give little Gerda nothing to take which will endue her with power over the whole?"]

Lapland
["Poor thing,""you have far to run still. You have more than a hundred miles to go before you get to Finland; there the Snow Queen has her country-house, and burns blue lights every evening. I will give you a few words from me, which I will write on a dried haberdine, for paper I have none; this you can take with you to the Finland woman, and she will be able to give you more information than I can."]

man
["That’s glorious fun!"]

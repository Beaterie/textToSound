["There's a fellow who will give his father some trouble!""That, too, must be an art of which I understand nothing!""If that be all,""he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon polish him.""He can't mean to be as bad as his words,""Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower before you did.""No, I don"" replied the boy, "" The father was terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. "" "" he replied, "" said the father, "" "" spoke the father, ""  When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to himself: "" "" answered the youth, "" And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven. Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm themselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught their clothes. So he said: "" and he hung them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have the fifty talers, and said: "" answered he, ""  The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to himself: "" ""t know,""From whence do you come?""Who is your father?""What is it that you are always muttering between your teeth?""Ah,""I do so wish I could shudder, but no one can teach me how.""Enough of your foolish chatter,""If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!""If that is your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.""Ah, be silent,""so many prying persons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again.""However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.""Away with you, vermin,""It has not come to that yet.""I never expected to see you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?""That is no part of our bargain,""the bench is mine.""Yes, if you have any money.""Hurrah! now we'll have fun!""Have you not shuddered then?""I shall never learn it here as long as I live.""Not so fast,""I will soon seize you,""If you are stronger, I will let you go--come, we will try.""Now I have you,""I will find a cure for him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder."]

king
["You may ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must be things without life.""Then I ask for a fire, a turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.""Ah, if I could but shudder!""but I shall not learn it here either.""Au, miau! how cold we are!""You fools!""what are you crying about? If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.""Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?""Why not?""but just show me your paws.""Oh,""what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.""I have looked at your fingers,""and my fancy for card-playing has gone,""That is the very thing for me,""That's right,""but go faster.""Now anyone who likes, may drive,""After all it is a pity,--for so handsome a man.""Very well indeed,""one night is past, the two others will pass likewise.""No,""it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!""If I could but shudder!""Hullo!""another half belongs to this. This is not enough!""Wait,""I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.""Then,""you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.""That is all very well,""but still I do not know what it is to shudder!""If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder."]

father
["Oh, no father, I'll not go there, it makes me shudder!""Oh, it makes us shudder!""They are always saying: “It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!” It does not make me shudder,""Hearken to me, you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.""Well, father,""I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don't understand that at all yet.""You shall soon learn what it is to shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.""Just think,""when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he actually wanted to learn to shudder.""It will train the boy a little.""You shall soon learn what shuddering is,""Who is there?"]

man
["Listen you, can I join you?""Money enough,""but your balls are not quite round.""There, now they will roll better!""How has it fared with you this time?""I have been playing at nine-pins,""and have lost a couple of farthings.""What?""I have had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!""If I could but shudder.""Ha, ha, that is certainly my little cousin, who died only a few days ago,""Come, little cousin, come.""Wait,""I will warm you a little,""When two people lie in bed together, they warm each other,""See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?""Now will I strangle you.""What!""is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go into your coffin again,""I cannot manage to shudder,""You wretch,""you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.""If I am to die, I shall have to have a say in it.""Softly, softly, do not talk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.""We shall see,""I can do better than that,""Now it is your turn to die.""Of these,""one part is for the poor, the other for the king, the third yours.""I shall still be able to find my way out,""Now you must have learnt what shuddering is?""No,""what can it be? My dead cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder."]

brother
["Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is! He will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to be a sickle must bend himself betimes."]

boy
["Give an answer,""or take yourself off, you have no business here at night.""What do you want here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the steps!"" The woman ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.  She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy's father, "" cried she, "" said he. "" ""  "" "" Then a man approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see the gallows, the man said to him: "" Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and waited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself: "" The dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: "" "" Then the man saw that he would not get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: "" A waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ""I know not.""That I may not tell you.""Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.""If it be allowed, I will willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle."]

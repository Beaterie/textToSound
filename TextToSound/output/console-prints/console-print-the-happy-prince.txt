["How do you know?""you have never seen one.""It is a ridiculous attachment,""she has no money, and far too many relations""Will you come away with me?""I am off to the Pyramids.  Good-bye!""I am the Happy Prince.""When I was alive and had a human heart,""I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans- Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep.""Far away,""far away in a little street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion- flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen's maids-of- honour to wear at the next Court-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.""My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus- flowers.  Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there himself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.""How wonderful the stars are,""and how wonderful is the power of love!"" said the Swallow, who really had a good heart.  "" said the Prince; ""; and he began to weep.  ""  So the Swallow plucked out the Prince's eye, and flew away to the student's garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird's wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.  "" he cried; "" and he looked quite happy.  The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes.  ""! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  "" he cried.  ""  "" answered the Swallow, "" said the Happy Prince, "" said the Swallow, ""  So he plucked out the Prince's other eye, and darted down with it. He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand.  "" cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing.  Then the Swallow came back to the Prince.  "" he said, ""  "" said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.  All the next day he sat on the Prince's shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.  ""  So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another's arms to try and keep themselves warm.  "" shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.  Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.  "" said the Prince, "" they cried.  Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.  The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the baker's door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.  But at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more.  "" he murmured, "" said the Prince, "" said the Swallow.  "" he said.  "" said the Town Councillors.  ""  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.  So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  "" he said, "" said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.  When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.  ""  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying.  "" said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.  "" said God, "]

Professor
["What a remarkable phenomenon,"]

mother
["Why can't you be like the Happy Prince?""I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,""I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy."]

Prince
["Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,""will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad.""Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller's sons, who were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.""Thank you, little Swallow,""That is because you have done a good action,""A swallow in winter!""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,""will you not stay with me one night longer?""To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions come down to the water's edge to drink.  They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.  ""  ""  ""  "" said the Swallow, "]

children
["Ah! but we have, in our dreams,"]

Town Councillors
["He is as beautiful as a weathercock,""only not quite so useful,""The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything."]

Swallow
["Shall I love you?""Why are you weeping then?""you have quite drenched me.""What! is he not solid gold?""I am waited for in Egypt,""I don't think I like boys,""To-night I go to Egypt,""What a distinguished stranger!""I am waited for in Egypt,"" said the Prince, "" said the Prince, "" they shouted as each chest came up.  "" said the Prince, ""  ""  ""  "" said the Prince, ""  "" said the poor Prince, "" said the Prince, "" they said.  ""  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children's faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street.  ""  ""  ""  And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.  At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.  It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.  Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked up at the statue:  "" cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.  ""  "" continued the Mayor.  "]

man
["I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,""She has no conversation,""and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.""I admit that she is domestic,""but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.""You have been trifling with me,""Where shall I put up?""I hope the town has made preparations.""I will put up there,""it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.""I have a golden bedroom,""What a curious thing!""there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.""What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?""I must look for a good chimney-pot,""Who are you?""It is very cold here,""but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger."]

Children
["He looks just like an angel,"]

boy
["How cool I feel,""I must be getting better""It is curious,""but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.""Have you any commissions for Egypt?""I am just starting."" said the Mayor in fact, "" said the Art Professor at the University.  Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  ""  "" said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.  "]
